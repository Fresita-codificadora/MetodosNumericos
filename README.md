# MetodosNumericos
Various numerical methods programmed in Octave. 

Everything will soon be compiled into a couple of general scripts, to organize things a little bit more, that is, whenever I have the time to do it. 

The folders called "f_..." contain mostly functions, in case you find yourself more attracted to those, as opposed to the general scripts found on the main page. 

Packages required to run some of the scripts:  
Symbolic Package: https://github.com/cbm755/octsympy 
Splines Package: https://octave.sourceforge.io/splines/index.html

If you find any problems, please submit an issue.
